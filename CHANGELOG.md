This is a maintenance release.

Maintenance:
  * (EZ-128) Add `numeric-uid-gid` option to allow for specifying a desired
    uid/gid. We have a reserved uid/gid for the 'puppet' user, so this option
    allows us to explicitly set that. Note that this only affects rpm packaging.
  * (EZ-129) Set `TasksMax` to 4915, since some versions of systemd set
    `TasksMax` to 512, which is not enough for certain applications.

Feature:
  * (EZ-127) Add docker-build to build an image from a clojure repo

Feature:
  * (CPR-515) Add support for setting postinstall actions that should happen on
    initial install only.

Bugfix:
  * Reverts commit setting `build_tar: FALSE` in foss build defaults. This fix

## 1.7.1 - 2017-11-29
This is a bugfix release.

Bugfix:
  * Generate valid replaces/conflicts in RPM and deb packaging
  * Pass MOCK and COW environment variables through to the jenkins job during
    a `lein ezbake build`.
  * If `repo-target` is unspecified debian artifacts should end up under
    `deb/<platform>` instead of `deb/<platform>/main`.


## 1.7.0 - 2017-11-14
This is a feature release.

Feature:
  * (EZ-111) Add support for RPM triggers. You can now add postinstall triggers
    that run on either installs or upgrades via the
    `redhat-postinst-install-triggers` or `redhat-postinst-upgrade-triggers`
    variables under `:lein-ezbake` in your project.clj. These variables are
    arrays of hashes in the format [ { :package "package", :scripts ["script 1", "script2"] } ]
  * (EZ-113) Add support for Debian triggers. This adds support for activate
    triggers via the `debian-activated-triggers` variable. This variable takes
    an array of trigger names. This also adds support for interest triggers for
    either install or upgrade via the `debian-interested-install-triggers` and
    `debian-interested-upgrade-triggers` variables. These variables are arrays
    of hashes in the format [ { :interest-name "trigger", :scripts ["script1", "script2"] } ]
    All of these variables are set under `:lein-ezbake` in your project.clj.

## 1.6.7 - 2017-11-29

Bugfix:
  * Generate valid replaces/conflicts in RPM and deb packaging
  * Pass MOCK and COW environment variables through to the jenkins job during
    a `lein ezbake build`.

## 1.6.5 - 2017-11-14

  * Pass `create-dirs` from ezbake config to FPM packaging

## 1.6.4 - 2017-11-10
This release was incorrectly published as 1.6.4. Do not use this release.

## 1.6.3 - 2017-10-02
This is a bugfix release.

Bugfix:
  * We were incorrectly setting the package release to the package version if
    it was not a SNAPSHOT build. The release is now set to 1 unless we have a
    SNAPSHOT build. Behavior for SNAPSHOT builds is unchanged.

## 1.6.2 - 2017-09-25
This is a bugfix release.

Bugfix:
  * We were generating invalid bash (empty if block) if there were no additional
    dependencies specified.
  * We weren't keeping the output tarball with the packaging artifacts.

## 1.6.1 - 2017-09-15
This is a bugfix and maintenance release.

Bugfix:
  * There was a bad version check that caused sles 12 packages to not get init
    scripts. This has been fixed.
  * We were attempting to reuse packaging artifacts but were deleting them after
    each platform was packaged. Moved the delete to after all platforms ran.

Maintenance:
  * Clean up debug output to accurately represent the options hash.
  * Update `help` output to print correct platforms
  * Print the URL for where the packages are going to be staged at the end of
    the `build` step.

## 1.6.0 - 2017-09-13
This is a feature and maintenance release.

Feature:
  * Added `local-build` task to allow building ezbake projects on infrastructure
    outside of Puppet. There is more information available in the README but
    this addition enables package building on any machine/VM/container/etc with
    the necessary dependencies installed.
  * Changes to `build` task to let it use new infrastructure and CI systems.
    These changes should be transparent with the exception of needing to pass
    jenkins authorization at runtime. This should be passed in the
    JENKINS_USER_AUTH environment variable as either '<job token>' or
    '<ldap username>:<personal auth token>'.
  * Added `legacy-build` task to preserve the `build` task from previous versions
    of ezbake.

Maintenance:
  * Document installation has been moved into the install.sh script. We were
    previously installing the docs with `%doc` entries and the doc control file.
    The `install.sh` script now installs the docs in the os-specific location to
    enable us to more easily change how we are packaging.

## 1.5.2 - 2017-08-29
Maintenance:
  * Removes Ubuntu Yakkety and Ubuntu Precise from the default COW list as those
    platforms are EOL.

Bugs:
  * Get dependencies from requirements which do not have version numbers
    associated with it, as well parent dependencies.

## 1.5.0 - 2017-6-30
This is a feature release.

Feature:
  * (RE-8861) Generate metadata files when building projects.
    Adds a new `manifest` command that creates an 'ext/build_metadata.json' file
    containing dependencies and related metadata to aid in tracking down
    differences between packages built with ezbake.
    This file is also created during the `stage` and `build` actions.

## 1.4.0 - 2017-5-18
This is a feature, maintenance, and bug fix release.

Feature:
  * (RE-8726) Add support for specifying nonfinal vs. final repo targets and
    names.

Maintenance:
  * (RE-4844) Merge together content from the FOSS and PE ezbake templates.

Bugs:
  * (EZ-109) Eliminate some unnecessarily duplicated strings from the
    ezbake.manifest file.
  * (EZ-110) Retain any qualifying attributes (e.g., exclusions) when expanding
    a SNAPSHOT version for a coordinate, allowing exclusions to be reflected
    properly in the resulting ezbake.manifest file.
  * (EZ-110) For an `additional-uberjar`, build the immediate jar into the final
    uberjar even when the project has defined its own `uberjar` profile.

## 1.3.0 - 2017-5-3
This is a feature release
  * (SERVER-1772) Add support for building and installing additional uberjars.
    An `:additional-uberjars` EZBake setting has been added which allows projects
    to specify a list of versioned dependencies that will be built and installed
    next to the projects own uberjar.
  * (SERVER-1772) Support installing a `cli-defaults.sh` file which can be
    configured by EZBake projects and supply defaults for bash variables in a
    project's cli scripts
  * (EZ-108) Add support for `EZBAKE_ALLOW_UNREPRODUCIBLE_BUILDS` environment
    variable that when defined, will allow staging with undeployed SNAPSHOT
    versions

## 1.2.1 - 2017-4-20
  * (SERVER-1782) Fix for the openjdk8 package name in SLES-12

## 1.2.0 - 2017-4-12
This release removes Java7 support and changes the way that snapshots are deployed

Feature:
  * Remove Java 7 compatibility. Builds now assume Java (openjdk) 8
  * Change EZBake's stage command to:
      * Deploy an artifact to the configured snapshots repository when staging a project with
        a snapshot version.
      * List the deployed snapshot artifact's version as the project's version number in the
        ezbake.manifest & project_data.yaml files.
      * Resolve all dependencies with 'SNAPSHOT' versions to get a deployed snapshot artifact
        from the repository and list that artifact's version number in the ezbake.manifest &
        project_data.yaml. If no deployed snapshot artifacts can be found for the listed
        snapshot version, then an error is thrown and staging is aborted, to prevent
        unreproducible builds.
      * List each dependency's group as well as its name in the ezbake.manifest &
        project_data.yaml

## 1.1.8 - 2017-3-22
