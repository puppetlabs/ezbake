;; leery of introducing another template language since we're already using
;; erb... but I think I'd have to in order to do this from clojure.  The other
;; option would be to implement all of this logic in ruby and just use erb, but
;; then I couldn't use the lein project file format as the way to represent
;; the data for a project (e.g. `configs/jvm-puppet.clj`).  I'd have to use some
;; other config format that ruby could read, and then generate a lein project
;; file from that.  All of these options sound unappealing in their own special
;; ways.
